# string-conversions [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soenkehahn/string-conversions.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/soenkehahn/string-conversions)

This is a tiny library to convert between multiple string types in Haskell.

[text-conversions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-conversions) is very similar in size and purpose.  Which one you should use may be a matter of taste.
